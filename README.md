Hello everyone!
On this individual project, I analyzed the OASIS-1: Demographic and Clinical data, found at: [OASIS Brains](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-1/)

I started by uploading the CSV file using pandas, giving it a quick read and starting the EDA. 

[EDA](#EDA.ipynb)

Later, I moved to PowerBI to build visual reports.

[Dashboard](#oasis1.pbix)

[First report](/report_1.jpeg)

[Second report](/report_2.jpeg)

Based on the Exploratory Data Analysis and the visual reports, I found out that:
- The people who participated on this study, were all right handed.
-  Most of them, were female.
-  The average education level was 3.
-  The average CDR for each gender was: 0,26 on females and 0,34 on males.
-  The CDR increased on patients above the age of 61.

  Although this is a basic project, I thought it'd be worth to include on this portfolio to keep practicing my skills. 
  Thanks to everyone who watched it!
